                I was born in Venezuela and came to the US when I was 12.
                My family and I came to live the American Dream.  I graduated
                college with a teaching degree in mathematics (later ended up
                getting my masters as well).  I am now working on improving myself
                and looking for new opportunities in the coding world.
